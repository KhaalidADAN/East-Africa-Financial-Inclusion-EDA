# 🌐 Fintech Analysis on Financial Inclusion in East Africa

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of **financial inclusion in East Africa**, focusing on **bank account ownership** across demographics in **Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, and Rwanda**. Through an extensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** approach, we uncover barriers and opportunities for expanding financial access, highlighting how demographic factors like **location, income, education, age, gender, and employment status** influence financial inclusion.

## 🎯 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Each EDA stage unveils insights into the factors shaping financial inclusion across East Africa:

- **Missing Data Analysis 🛠️**: Managed missing values, particularly in numeric fields such as age and household size, using median imputation to maintain data integrity for accurate analysis.
- **Distribution of Key Variables 📊**: Explored the spread of age, income, and education levels to reveal initial demographic trends.
- **Univariate Analysis 📈**: Examined each variable individually, identifying specific characteristics in financial access, such as the concentration of young respondents and location-based differences.
- **Bivariate Analysis 🔗**: Assessed relationships between pairs of variables, highlighting how factors like income and education or gender and location influence bank account ownership.
- **Multivariate Analysis 🎯**: Analyzed the combined impact of demographics, revealing complex interactions—such as urban, educated men having the highest account ownership rates, while rural women face significant barriers.
- **Correlation Analysis 🔄**: Explored correlations among variables, confirming that higher education and income levels improve financial access.

## 📊 Key Findings
These analyses led to several valuable insights into financial inclusion challenges in East Africa:

1. **Socioeconomic and Geographic Barriers**: Urban residents, educated individuals, and higher-income respondents have significantly higher access to banking services. This indicates a need for targeted financial inclusion initiatives for rural, low-income, and less-educated populations.

2. **Gender and Financial Access**: Men show higher bank account ownership than women, with the disparity more pronounced in rural areas. This highlights the need for gender-sensitive financial programs, especially in underserved communities.

3. **Income-Education Correlation**: Education strongly correlates with income, suggesting that increased educational opportunities may facilitate financial inclusion by boosting income potential and improving financial literacy.

4. **Young Demographics**: A large proportion of respondents were younger, reflecting the need for financial products catering to youth, who may have different financial behaviors and requirements.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
The analysis uses:
- **Python**: For data processing and analysis.
- **Pandas**: For efficient data handling and transformation.
- **Seaborn**: For visually engaging, dark-themed visualizations that highlight demographic insights.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data exploration and documentation.
